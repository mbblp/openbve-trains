The R188 is an A division car for the New York City Subway. The MTA is planning to displace the R62As from the 7 train with these cars, and automate the IRT Flushing Line.





The R188 order originally consisted of 186 new cars, as well as 131 converted R142A cars compatible with communication-based train control (CBTC) and an additional 189 R142A conversion kits for MTA, totaling a possible 506 cars, or in other words, 46 eleven car trains. Given this number, it can be deduced that 230 of these cars will be arranged in 5 car sets while the remaining 276 cars will be arranged in 6 car sets.[1]
According to the 2010-2014 capital plan, 146 new cars were to be purchased. Of these new cars, 110 cars would go to make up 10 new eleven car trains, while the remaining 36 cars were to be "C" cars that would go to expanding 36 CBTC upgraded R142A 5-car sets (360 existing cars) to 6 car length. The original planned total of 46 eleven car trains (506 cars) would still result from this order.





The contract was awarded in Spring 2010 to Kawasaki Heavy Industries, who won by default since only two manufacturers qualified and Bombardier Transportation opted not to bid on the contract citing the small order and large requirement for engineering resources. The contract was specified at $87,094,272 for the base order, which consisted of 33 cars (23 new cars and 10 conversions), and $384,315,168 for the option order, which consisted of 473 cars (123 new cars, and 350 conversions) for a total price of $471,409,440. The 10 converted R142A cars from the base order were completed during the 4th quarter of 2011 while the 23 new cars are scheduled for delivery by the 4th quarter of 2012. The first 88 option cars (eight 11 car sets) are scheduled to be delivered from the 4th quarter of 2013 through the 2nd quarter of 2014 while the remaining 35 new cars and the 350 conversions are scheduled for delivery and conversion from the 1st quarter of 2014 through the 4th quarter of 2015. The conversion cars under the base contract were converted at Kawasaki's Yonkers facility while the rest of the conversions were originally to take place on the property by a joint team of Kawasaki and NYCTA personnel at the 207th Street Overhaul Shop.[4][5]
In March 2011, R142As 7211-7215 were taken out of service to be retrofitted with CBTC as prototypes for the R188s. R142As 7216-7220 were taken out of service for this same reason in June 2011.[6] In December 2011, these cars completed conversion and were delivered for on-site testing.
On December 16th, 2011, an additional modification to the contract was made. In the latest revision, only 103 new cars were to be purchased to form 8 new 11 car trains. Likewise, the number of conversion cars was altered to 370. This change was made with the knowledge that only two growth sets would be needed as opposed to the projected four sets, and thus, the MTA and Kawasaki opted to convert two additional R142A train sets in place of manufacturing two new sets. The MTA also decided to have Kawasaki perform all of the conversions at the Yonkers plant instead of 207th Street Shop as part of that contract modification.[7]
As of January 24th, 2012, R188s 7211-7220 have been delivered to Corona Yard for testing on the Flushing line.[8][9][10][11]
As of July 19th, 2012, R188s 7811-7813 are at Kawasaki's Yonkers plant and awaiting truck installation and subsequent testing.
According to the latest update, the MTA expects to have 8 conversion sets in service by the time that the Flushing Line Extension is opened for revenue service. In addition, the breakdown of the trainsets has been disclosed. Breakdown is as follows: A-C-B-B-A+A-B-B-B-C-A; where dashes signify link bars and the addition sign denotes couplers
