Thank you for downloading this add-on from the
BVE UK Train Collection. It is hoped that you enjoy
using this train with the BVE cab-view simulator,
available from Mackoy's Official BVE website:

[http://mackoy.cool.ne.jp/]

This train is suitable for running in BVE2 and BVE4.

Features: - 
 - fully working AWS and TPWS when run on suitably 
   equipped routes under BVE4;
 - fully working Driver's Reminder Appliance, 
   Vigilance device and traction safety interlocks
   when run in BVE4;
 - fully working wipers and windscreen rain drop
   effects on suitably equipped routes under BVE 4;
 - simulated neutral section power cut effects on
   suitably equipped routes under BVE 4;
 - semi-functional AWS when run on BVE2 routes fitted 
   with the system developed by Nathan Whitington 
   and Steve Green.

This add-on is compliant with the BVE Track Sound
Standard [BVETSS], so whenever the train is used in
combination with a BVETSS compliant route the correct
track sounds are guaranteed to be heard.
