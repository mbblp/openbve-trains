<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId553174"></a>Introduction</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The 90mph Class 323 units were built by
Hunslet Transportation of Leeds during the early 1990s to replace older
trains on intensive suburban services around Manchester and
Birmingham.&nbsp; To ensure timekeeping on routes with frequent stops,
they have lightweight aluminium bodies and use AC traction motors
controlled by inverters (which produces the characteristic 'Magic
Zanussi' sound as they pull away from stops) and regenerative
braking.&nbsp; Class 323s are currently used by Northern Rail and by
Central Trains under the 'Centro' brand.<br>
<br>
This model is an update of the existing BVE4 model with the latest
version of the UKMUt plugin that provides a number of new
features for enhanced realism, including:<br>
<ul>
  <li>additional starting conditions<br>
  </li>
  <li>working windscreen wipers</li>
  <li>fully modelled pantograph with</li>
  <ul>
    <li>pantograph up/down features</li>
    <li>realistic behaviour at neutral sections<br>
    </li>
    <li>correct interlocking with power and auxiliary systems<br>
    </li>
  </ul>
  <li>driver operated head and tail lights with 'proving lights'</li>
</ul>
Please read through this guide before driving the train for the first
time, to familiarise yourself with the train and its controls.<br>

</div>
<br>
<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId868078"></a>At the Start of the
Run<br>
</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">When you join the train, it will be in
one of three conditions, selected by the author of the orute you are
driving:<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId130993"></a><a name="Shut_Down"></a>Shut
Down</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The train has been completely shut down
for stabling; there are no lights on the control desk and the cab is
quiet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Before you can drive the train, you must:<br>
<ul>
  <li>activate the control desk</li>
  <li>raise the pantograph</li>
  <li>set the correct headlights</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId455489"></a>Changing Direction</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">You have just changed ends, or have
joined a train which needs to reverse for its next journey.&nbsp; The
pantograph is up and you will see the line volts indicator illuminated
and hear the noise of the fans.&nbsp; The proving lights (<a
 href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span style="font-weight: bold;">12</span></a>)
indicate that the tail lights are still on from
the previous journey. However, the control desk is
switched off and before you can drive the train, you must:<br>
<ul>
  <li>activate the control desk</li>
  <li>set the correct headlights</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId180505"></a>Neutral</h3>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The control desk is active, the
headlights set and the train is ready to proceed.<br>
</div>
<br>
Follow the instructions below to prepare the train for departure: <br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId244766"></a> To activate the
control desk:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Move the reverser ([up-arrow] key) from <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">off</span> to <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">forward</span> and back again (the reverser
is now in the <span style="font-weight: bold;">neutral</span>
position).&nbsp; Immediately you will see:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>the AWS/TPWS self test sequence begin</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;">If the pantograph is already
raised</span>, you will also notice</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>the Driver's Reminder Appliance (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">7</span></a>) illuminates</li>
    <li>the sound of the fans starting up</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>The AWS/TPWS self test runs quickly through the following stages:</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>the AWS indicator (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">4</span></a>)
turns from black to the 'sunflower' and returns to black;</li>
    <li>the lamps on the TPWS panel (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">6</span></a>)
are illuminated;</li>
    <li>the AWS warning horn sounds.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <li>Press <span style="font-style: italic;">and release</span> the
AWS reset
button&nbsp; ([Insert] key) to: </li>
  <ul>
    <li>stop the warning tone;</li>
    <li>change the AWS indicator to the 'sunflower' again;</li>
    <li>extinguish the lamps on the TPWS panel.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>
    </li>
  </ul>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">A short 'bing' may be heard when you
release the AWS reset button - this is a normal part of testing the AWS
equipment.<br>
<br>
</div>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> - until the AWS reset
button is pressed and released, the brakes are held <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">on</span> and the unit
cannot be moved.<br>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><br>
</div>
<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId345482"></a>To raise the
pantograph<br>
</h3>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note</span> - the pantograph cannot be
raised unless the train is stationary, the power handle <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">off</span> and the reverser in <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">neutral</span>.<br>
<ol>
  <li>Press the Pantograph Up/Reset button ([2] key). You should hear
the noise of the pantograph being raised: if not check the positions of
your reverser and power handle! </li>
  <br>
  <li>After a few seconds, you will hear brief sparking as the
pantograph makes contact with the overhead supply;</li>
  <br>
  <li><span style="font-style: italic;"></span>You will also notice</li>
  <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
    <li>the Driver's Reminder Appliance (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span

<ol>
  <li>If necessary, press [4] to switch off the tail lights;<br>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li>Use the headlight switch ([5] key) to set the appropriate lights:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>for daytime services press <span style="font-weight: bold;">once</span>
to set 'headlights, day'</li>

proving lights (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">12</span></a>) on the panel
change as you press the keys.&nbsp; Note that the headlight switch is a
rotary switch and will cycle repeatedly through the available settings
if you continue to press it.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId736798"></a>Note on the DRA</h3>
Network Rail rules require that the DRA be switched on whenever the
driver leaves the cab, so whichever condition the train is in when you
join it, you will find that you have to switch off the <a
 href="#The_Class_323_Cab">Driver's Reminder Appliance (7)</a> before
starting.<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId465808"></a>Before driving away</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Set the reverser to <span style="font-weight: bold;">forward</span>
in order to engage the door interlock and prevent the train from moving
until the doors are closed.</li>
</ol>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Caution</span>
- if the reverser is in <span style="font-weight: bold;">neutral</span>,
the door interlock is inactive and the train may roll if the brakes are
inadvertantly released.<br>
</div>
<ol start="2">
  <li>If the starter signal is not showing red, you may switch off
the Driver's Reminder Appliance (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">7</span></a>)
by pressing [space]; otherwise <span style="font-weight: bold;">wait</span>
until the signal clears to yellow.&nbsp; The DRA illumination is
extinguished when you switch off.<br>

  <br>
  <li>Wait for the Guard's buzzer signal before driving away.<br>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId840855"></a>Notes on using the
BVE 'restart' and 'jump to' features:</h3>
When the you use the BVE <span style="font-style: italic;">restart </span>or&nbsp;
<span style="font-style: italic;">jump to</span> features, the plugin
automatically selects the correct starting state:<br>
<ul>
  <li>following <span style="font-weight: bold;">restart</span><span
 style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"> </span>or a<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">jump
to</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"> the originating station</span>,
the
starting state specified in the route file is selected</li>
  <li>following a <span style="font-weight: bold;">jump
to</span>
any other station, the train is restarted in the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">neutral</span> state described above<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId372152"></a>Important - after
using <span style="font-style: italic;">jump to</span></h4>
Following a <span style="font-style: italic;">jump to</span>, you must
ensure that the controls are resynchronised with the
plugin by<br>
<ol>
  <li>returning the reverser to <span style="font-weight: bold;">neutral</span></li>
  <li>applying full service brakes</li>
</ol>
Failure to do so may mean you cannot start the train!<br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId627711"></a>Using the power handle</h3>
<font size="+0">The Class 323 is fitted with a combined power and brake
handle, with <span style="font-weight: bold;">four </span>power
notches (see below for information about braking notches): the model
correctly represents this and
features an animated handle (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">1</span></a>).&nbsp; To operate the handle:<br>
</font>
<ul>
  <li>press [Q] to increase braking (or reduce power)</li>
  <li>press [Z] to increase power (or reduce braking)</li>
  <li>press [A] to move the handle towards the centre <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">OFF </span>position<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<div><font size="+0">When starting, the power handle is usually moved
straight to notch <span style="font-weight: bold;">four</span> and the
model will give the most realistic sound effects when driven like
this.&nbsp; Use the lower notches to maintain the desired speed or to
avoid slipping when starting in conditions of low adhesion, such as
rain or snow.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note </span>- the maximum permitted
speed for a Class 323 is 90mph and the prototype is fitted with a speed
limiter (not modelled) to prevent this being exceeded. <br>
<br>
</font>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId798255"></a>Negotiating Neutral
Sections</h3>
The overhead line is supplied by&nbsp; feeder
stations spaced around 30 miles apart. For technical reasons, they must
be kept electrically isolated from each other and this is
achieved using <span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-style: italic;">neutral sections</span></span>: short
lengths of the overhead line insulated from the preceding and following
sections and connected to earth.&nbsp; Neutral sections will usually be
found adjacent to feeder stations and about halfway between them -
i.e. around 15 miles apart.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="Neutral section"

placed just before and after the neutral section and all trains are
fitted with suitable receivers.&nbsp; The APC magnets operate a circuit
breaker on the train, which disconnects and reconnects the pantograph
automatically
as the train passes the neutral section; nevertheless, drivers are
instructed to <span style="text-decoration: underline;">shut off power</span>

and <span style="font-weight: bold;">3</span>, and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">emergency </span>positions; the brakes are
released in the centre OFF position and in all power notches.<br>
<br>
The Class 323 features regenerative braking: by using the traction
motors as alternators the kinetic energy of the train is returned as
electric current to the overhead supply for use by other trains on the
system.&nbsp; At low speeds, or if the overhead supply cannot accept
regenerated current (because no other trains in the area are motoring),
the brake controller automatically blends in air driven disc brakes to
give the required amount of braking. The brake cylinder gauge (<a
 href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2</span></a>,
right hand needle), shows the current air pressure in the brake
cylinder, which is related to the brake notch selected, but will also
vary with train speed as the brake controller blends the two braking
modes. BVE models this correctly and you will see the needle rise as
the train comes to a stand.<br>
<br>
Note that typically
drivers use only Step 1 or Step 2 in service, and Step 3 only as a
backup.&nbsp; To ensure a smooth stop, reduce the amount of braking
just before the train comes to a stand.<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId224288"></a>Stopping at stations</h3>
Unlike BVE2, BVE4 does not provide an indicator to help you stop at
stations.&nbsp; You will need to learn the route and practise driving
the train in order to stop smoothly and precisely.&nbsp; Fortunately,
BVE4, <span style="font-style: italic;">does</span> allow route
authors to specify what the acceptable limits for stopping at each
station are and they are usually more lenient than the limits in
BVE2.&nbsp; Most routes also have a marker at the correct stopping
point (though they can be prototypically hard to see!) : on British
routes be sure that you know how long your train is, so that you know
which of the numbered stop plates applies to you.<br>
<br>
If you stop too far from the correct position, BVE will display a
message asking you to move forward or back as appropriate.&nbsp; On
suitably equipped routes, the Class 323 also plays the correct Guard's
buzzer signal:<br>
<ul>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">six</span> beats - draw forward</li>
  <li><span style="font-weight: bold;">three</span> beats - set back</li>
</ul>
If you hear either of these signals, acknowledge it to the Guard using
the [6] key, before moving the train.<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId419624"></a>Operating the doors</h3>
<h4>Normal operation by the Guard<br>
</h4>
The model is configured so that the Guard will normally operate the
doors; on suitably equipped routes the plugin will also ensure that the
open and close sounds are played on the correct side.&nbsp; Interlocks
prevent you from starting the train until the doors are closed -
signalled by the Doors Closed indicator (<a style="font-weight: bold;"
 href="#The_Class_323_Cab">16</a>) being illuminated.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note - </span>the doors cannot be
opened or closed if power is unavailable because the pantograph is
down. If you have not raised the pantograph by the due departure time
of your train, the Guard will close them as soon as power is available.<br>
<h4><span style="font-weight: bold;">Note on door reopening by BVE</span></h4>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span
 style="font-style: italic;"></span>The repeated reopening of the doors
before departure is an annoying feature of BVE4.&nbsp; On this train,
the plugin plays the door close sounds only when it is notified by BVE
that the doors have finally closed, so you will experience 'door
thrashing' merely as an extended station stop.<br>
<h4>Driver operation of the doors</h4>
It should not normally be necessary for you to operate the doors
yourself.&nbsp; If you wish to do so, however, first ensure that BVE is
in <a href="#Dev_Mode"><span style="font-style: italic;">Developer Mode</span></a>,
then <span style="font-weight: bold;"><br>

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId388567"></a>Interlocks</h3>
The Class 323 is fitted with several prototypical interlocks to
increase driving realism:<br>
<h4>Power Interlocks:</h4>
Until the pantograph is raised:<br>
<ul>
  <li>the DRA (<a style="font-weight: bold;" href="#The_Class_323_Cab">7</a>)
and proving lights (<a style="font-weight: bold;"
 href="#The_Class_323_Cab">12</a>) will not illuminate, regardless of
the corresponding switch settings</li>
  <li>the doors will not close</li>
  <ul>
    <li>if you forget to raise the pantograph when you join a <a
 href="#Shut_Down">shut-down</a> train, the Guard will not close the
doors and give the ready to start signal until the pantograph is fully
up and power is available!</li>
  </ul>
</ul>
<h4>Door Interlocks</h4>
So long as the reverser is in <span style="font-weight: bold;">forward</span>
or <span style="font-weight: bold;">reverse</span>, the brakes are
held at full service while the doors are open.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId696706"></a>Reverser</h4>
If you move the reverser to <span style="font-weight: bold;">neutral</span>
while the train is in motion, full service brakes will be applied.<br>
<ul>
  <li>move the reverser to <span style="font-weight: bold;">forward</span>
again to release the brakes</li>
  <li>move the power handle to <span style="font-weight: bold;">off</span>
before reapplying power</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId480724"></a>Lowering the
pantograph<br>
</h4>
There is <span style="font-weight: bold;">no</span> interlock to
prevent you lowering the pantograph while the train is in motion!&nbsp;
If
you inadvertantly do so, the train will be braked to a stand; remember
that you must ensure that:<br>
<ul>
  <li>the train is at a stand,</li>
  <li>the power handle is <span style="font-weight: bold;">off</span>,</li>
  <li>the reverser is <span style="font-weight: bold;">neutral</span>,</li>
</ul>
before you can attempt to raise the pantograph.<br>

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId631812"></a>Safety Systems</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">All the safety systems currently in use

</ul>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId314012"></a>AWS</h3>
AWS (<span style="font-style: italic;">Automatic Warning System</span>)
is a relatively old system that dates from the 1950s.&nbsp; It uses a
magnet placed between the rails before a signal to operate a receiver
on the train and inform the driver of the state of the signal using
audible signals and the AWS Display (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">4</span></a>) in the cab; it is
also used to warn of approaching speed restrictions.&nbsp; The Class
323 accurately represents the behaviour of AWS on a TPWS-fitted train,
which differs in some details from that of a non-TPWS-fitted train.<br>
<br>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="AWS magnet"

 style="width: 336px; height: 190px;"><br>
</div>
<br>
On approaching signals, you will see the (usually) yellow magnet,
placed between the rails about 200m before the signal.&nbsp; Your
actions depend on the aspect the signal is showing:<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId506879"></a>If the signal is
green (or semaphore distant at 'clear')</h4>
<ul>
  <li>the AWS display (<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">4</span></a>)
changes to or remains black</li>
  <li>a bell or electronic 'bing' sounds (the Class 323 uses the
electronic tone)</li>
  <li>you need take no action</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId2809"></a>If the signal is red,
yellow or double yellow (or semaphore distant
at 'caution')</h4>
<ul>
  <li>the AWS display changes to or remains black</li>
  <li>a warning horn or electronic tone sounds continuously<br>
  </li>
  <li>you must press <span style="font-style: italic;">and release</span>
the AWS reset button ([Insert] key) within <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">2-3 seconds</span></li>
</ul>
When you have pressed and released the reset button<br>
<ul>
  <li>the warning horn is silenced</li>
  <li>the AWS display changes to the black and yellow 'sunflower' to
remind you that <span style="font-weight: bold;">you may be
approaching a red signal</span>.</li>
</ul>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId169933"></a>If you fail to

<ul>
  <li>the horn is silenced</li>
  <li>the TPWS Brake Demand lamp changes to steady illumination</li>
  <li>the AWS display changes to the 'sunflower'</li>
</ul>
The brake application is maintained for a period of one minute, after
which it is released automatically and the Brake Demand light goes
out.&nbsp; You may now restart the train.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Remember</span> - you may have to

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId853949"></a>'Fixed' AWS magnets</h4>
Fixed AWS magnets are not controlled by a signal and are used to warn
of the approach of a speed restriction.&nbsp; They always cause the

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId983154"></a>TPWS</h3>
AWS gives the same warning for red, yellow and double yellow signals
and in the past this has led to confusion; in addition it does not
actually prevent a train from passing a red signal (an event known as a
<span style="font-style: italic;">SPAD</span> - <span
 style="font-style: italic;">signal passed at danger</span>).&nbsp; To
give improved protection against SPADs, TPWS (<span
 style="font-style: italic;">Train Protection and Warning System</span>)
has been introduced onto Network Rail in the past few years.&nbsp; It
aims to stop trains either before a red signal, or within the safety
zone beyond the signal known as the <span style="font-style: italic;">overlap</span>,
which must always be clear before a train is allowed to approach the
signal.<br>
<br>
TPWS works using induction loops set between the rails and a receiver
on the train.&nbsp; There are actually two types of TPWS
installation:&nbsp; the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Overspeed
Sensor</span> (<span style="font-weight: bold;">OSS)</span>, which
stops trains that are travelling too fast, and the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Trainstop Sensor</span> (<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">TSS</span>), which stops trains that pass a
red signal. These are described below.<br>
<br>
Not all signals have yet been protected with TPWS: it was initially
applied where a SPAD would cause a particular danger of obstruction or
collision.&nbsp; It has also been used to enforce speed limits,
particularly on the approaches to terminal platforms and buffer stops.<br>

</h4>
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: center;">
<div style="text-align: left;">Overspeed sensors are placed on the
approach to signals (usually just before the AWS magnet) and at the
commencement of some speed restrictions.&nbsp; Those asociated with
signals are active <span style="font-weight: bold;">only</span> when
the signal is showing <span style="font-weight: bold;">red; </span>the
others are always active.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you drive too quickly over an

<br>
The speed limit in force over an OSS is either that indicated on the
adjacent sign, or, when approaching signals, a value typically from
30-60mph, depending on the location of the signal.&nbsp; A common value
used in BVE routes is <span style="font-weight: bold;">35mph</span>,
unless the local speed limit is already lower than this.<br>
<br>

Pressing and releasing the AWS reset button [Insert], causes the Brake

<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId266615"></a>Overriding the safety

The prototype TPWS is fitted with isolating controls that allow either<br>
<ul>
  <li>TPWS functions only, or</li>
  <li>AWS and TPWS functions</li>
</ul>
to be isolated.&nbsp; For the BVE model, the plugin provides the
(unprototypical!) ability to isolate TPWS, AWS <span

Device</a> as a developers' aid/route learning facility.&nbsp; To
override safety systems, press the [Page Down] key; press it again to
return to normal operation.&nbsp; The <a href="#TPWS_Cab_Equipment">Temporary
Isolation lamp</a> is illuminated while isolation is in force.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Note - </span>this feature can only
be accessed when all the equipment is in its normal state, i.e. no
warnings or alarms are sounding and no TPWS brake demand is active.<br>
<br>
<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId864938"></a><a
 name="Vigilance_Device"></a>Vigilance Device (VIG)<br>

The vigilance device sounds an alarm if none of the following controls
is operated within a 60 second period:<br>
<ul>
  <li>power handle</li>
  <li>brake handle</li>
  <li>AWS reset button</li>
</ul>
On the prototype, the driver then has <span style="font-weight: bold;">7
seconds</span> to release and redepress a pedal that must otherwise be
kept continuously depressed (the Driver's Safety Device).&nbsp; In the
BVE model, you must press and release the [Delete] key within the same
time: the alarm then stops sounding and the cycle is reset.<br>

</ul>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">Beware</span></span>,
however, if you set the reverser to neutral during a station stop to

<h3><a class="mozTocH3" name="mozTocId645247"></a>Driver's Reminder
Appliance (DRA)</h3>
The DRA was introduced in the 1990s in response to a series of
accidents where a driver had started away from a station stop against a
red signal.&nbsp; It is simply a manual switch that prevents power from
being applied when it is turned on.&nbsp; Drivers are required to set
the DRA:<br>
<ul>
  <li>when stopped at a red signal</li>
  <li>when leaving the cab</li>
</ul>
Press [Space] to toggle the DRA(<a href="#The_Class_323_Cab"><span

<h2><a class="mozTocH2" name="mozTocId764282"></a>Using the windscreen
wipers</h2>
<div style="margin-left: 40px;">The Class 323 features rain and working
windscreen wiper on suitably equipped routes.&nbsp; When rain begins to
fall, you will see and hear raindrops appearing on the windscreen - the
intensity of the rain is set by the route author, but also
increases with train speed.&nbsp; To wipe the windscreen, press the
[Home]
key once to select normal wiper speed; press again if fast wipe is
required.&nbsp; Press [End] to slow down or stop the wiper - note that
it will always return to its normal parking position before stopping.<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId999044"></a>Dry windscreen feature</h4>
Beware! If you leave the wipers on while the train is in a tunnel, or
if the rain stops, the windscreen will become dry and the normal swoosh
of
the wiper will change to an annoying (we hope) squeak.&nbsp; In light
rain you may find yourself constantly switching the wipers on and off -
don't forget to look out for signals :-)<br>
<h4><a class="mozTocH4" name="mozTocId415142"></a>Rain and framerates</h4>
The bitmaps used to display raindrops can cause a significant fall in
framerates on some computers.&nbsp; It helps to turn on the wiper and
remove the drops!<br>
